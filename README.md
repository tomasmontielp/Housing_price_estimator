# Housing_price_estimator
In this project, a simple and efficient model for predicting housing prices is done, going through the following steps:
- Exploratory data analysis: Looking at the target value (Sale price) and finding the more important features.
- Feature Engineering: treating missing data, outliers, generating new features, encoding data.
- Simple and efficient Model to predict prices: Reaching high accuracy, low RMSE, avoiding overfitting, and keeping it simple (only one parameter tuning).
